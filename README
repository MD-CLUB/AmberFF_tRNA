These force field library files are generated for 14 modified residues that appear in yeast tRNA-Asp, tRNA-Phe and tRNA-iMet: m1A, t6A, Ar(p), Cm, m5C, m7G, m22G, Gm, m1G, m2G, yW, m5U, D, Ψ, and three terminal 5’ phosphorylated residues: 5’ phosphate adenosine, 5’ phosphate guanosine, and 5’ phosphate uridine.
 
The charges were derived from the RESP fitting procedure. The parameters were derived from AMBER parm99.dat and gaff.dat. Some parameters not found in parm99.dat and gaff.dat were adapted from Tim Meyer and David Case's tRNAPhe force field library file. These parameters are suitable for use with the parm99 force field. Modify trna2.0.frcmod to other force fields if needed.
 
The files are as follows:
.prepi files:
5AP.prepi, 5GP.prepi, 5UP.prepi, RIA.prepi. Thoese files are the library files for 5’ phosphate adenosine, 5’ phosphate guanosine, 5’ phosphate uridine and Ar(p), which have a terminal phosphate.
 
trna2.0.lib:
This is the library files for all other modified residues.
 
trna2.0.frcmod:
This is the file holds all the derived parameters.

How to use:
#using amber10, ff99, tRNA-Asp(PDB:3TRA)
#Note: 
#1) 5AP.prepi, 5GP.prepi, 5UP.prepi, RIA.prepi is separated forcefield for residues with 5’-P. They should be read before sourcing the leaprc file.
#2) The phosphate name might give error when load pdb files, it is because of the nonstandard residues using ‘O1P’ and ‘O2P’ following previous literature convention. You may just edit the pdb file accordingly or modify the lib file changing them to ‘OP1’, ‘OP2’

leap.in example, load tRNA-asp (3TRA.db). It was tested with Amber10 and Amber11.
